* edit the products he has uploaded
* mark some of his products as *favorites*
* delete a product when it is sold
* bid some amount for a product he likes (But this is just to get listed in the owner's view and there is nothing like verification of account details, so it may also happen that a person can bid an amount that is less than the highest bid done. This is to ensure that all get a fair chance of bidding and no fake bids can rise issues.)
* edit his bid
* view bid history of a product he owns
